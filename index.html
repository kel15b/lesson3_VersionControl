            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Having a Version Control System (VCS) comes with its benefits. Some benefits include how files cannot be overwritten. Often many files can be overwritten with people not really realizing; it could happen by not noticing what someone is saving something as and overwriting something that was there. Another benefit is that it allows you to revert back to an older version of the file/project if needed. Many times, people save things they have touched up or worked on as the same name, therefore erasing the past file. If someone were to want to see the previous file they could not anymore, but with VCS they could. There are plenty of other benefits including these two that come with VCS.</p>

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">A centralized version control system fixes the issue that people encounter when they need to collaborate with developers on other systems. It is a single server that helps the clients and contains all versions of files throughout the history of the projects. An advantage of a centralized version control system is that basically everybody knows what everyone else is doing throughout the pace of the project. This system helps when there is a lot of people, but there are some negatives as well, including the fact that if the server goes down, then no one can work on the project.</p>

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Git began like most other things, with a little bit of creative destruction and fiery controversy. Linux kernel is a company that used BitKeeper for their files to be stored. After a while and a lot of projects being worked on, Linux and kernel broke down.  Linus Tarvalds and his other technicians wanted to develop their own tools they learned using BitKeeper. They wanted to create a system that has speed, a simple design, strong support for non-linear development, being fully distributed, and being able to handle large projects like the Linux kernel efficiently. These are things that many people would want to have with a system to store their projects.</p>

                <span class="text-muted">The Three States</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Throughout Git, it has three main states that files can reside in: committed, modified, and staged. Committed files is when you changed the file but have not committed it to your database yet. Another state is modified, which is when you have changed the file but have not committed it to your database yet. The last state is staged, this is when you have marked a modified file in its current version to go into your next commit snapshot. Along with these there are three main sections to a Git project: the Git directory, the working tree, and the staging area. A Git directory is where Git stores the metadata and object database for your project. The working tree is a single checkout of one version of the project. The staging area is a file, generally contained in your Git directory, that stores information about what will go into your next commit.</p>

                <span class="text-muted">Cloning an Existing Repository</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">To get a copy of an existing Git repository, the command you need is “git clone.” Someone would use clone instead of checkout with this because instead of just getting a working copy, Git can receive all copies of nearly all the data the server has. Then someone can clone a repository with “git clone <url>.” Then if someone wanted to clone the repository into a directory named something other than a specific name, you can specify that as the next command-line option. This command would do the same thing as the other one, but the target directory would be called that specific name.</p>
